  <summary>The problem statement</summary>
In the face of natural disasters, a country's resilience is put to the test as various organizations and individuals, including the government, rush to provide resources such as food, water, medicine, clothing, and shelter equipment. While the outpouring of support is commendable, the lack of a centralized agency coordinating based on ground realities creates challenges. This often results in an excess of certain items, while crucial necessities may be lacking. Compounding the issue is the lack of electricity and mobile networks in disaster-stricken areas.

For instance, in a flood scenario, well-meaning donors may contribute perishable items like rice, even though the immediate need could be for clean drinking water or basic medicines to address common ailments like fever, stomach pain, and diarrhea. Unfortunately, the excess rice may spoil due to inadequate storage or remain unused.

In the era of increasing climate change-related events, the frequency of such disasters is rising. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, hackfest team invites participants to devise innovative solutions to address the following challenges:

Solving Supply-Demand Issues: Propose strategies to balance the supply of donated goods with the actual demand on the ground. Matching the Supply-Demand: Develop systems or tools to efficiently match available resources with the specific needs of affected areas. Validating Requirements: Create mechanisms to validate and verify the actual requirements, ensuring that donations align with the most pressing needs. Broadcasting Requirements: Devise methods to effectively broadcast the identified needs to potential donors, taking into account the challenges of limited electricity and mobile networks. Ensuring Timely Fulfillment: Implement solutions that facilitate the timely delivery of required resources to affected regions, minimizing delays and bottlenecks. Real-time Requirement Updates: Explore ideas for maintaining up-to-date information on evolving needs, allowing for dynamic adjustments to donation efforts.
